        "This invention was made with government support under Grant Numbers DE-AC02-05CH11231 and DE-SC0019992 awarded by the Department of Energy The government has certain rights in the invention.",
        "TECHNICAL FIELD",
        "The disclosure provides for functionalized porous adsorbents and networks and uses thereof, including for use in selectively capturing and/or separating per- and poly-f luoroalkyl substances .",
        "BACKGROUND",
        "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PEAS) are a class of synthetic organof luorine molecules that typically have a hydrophobic fluorinated alkyl \"tail\" and a hydrophilic \"head\". This amphipathic nature makes PEAS excellent surfactants and has led to their widespread implementation in consumer and commercial products. However, PEAS leached from manufactured products can remain in the environment almost indefinitely due to their strong C-F bonds. As a result, PEAS are now detected in almost all components of the water cycle at concentrations as high as in the mg/L regime. Furthermore, PEAS bioaccumulate in the human body, and repeated exposure to even trace amounts can have consequences such as endocrine disruption, developmental toxicity, kidney and testicular cancer, immunotoxicity, and genotoxicity.",
        "The scope and severity of PEAS contamination in water, combined with the associated health risks, has led to significant regulatory action. In April 2024, the United States Environmental \n\nProtection Agency announced the final National Primary Drinking Water Regulation for six different PFAS. While these regulations are an important step forward, they are likely only the first of many to come. There are hundreds of PFAS of environmental concern, but the occurrence and toxicity of most are severely under studied. It is therefore imperative that water treatment technologies target the removal of all PFAS, including those that are not yet regulated.",
        "SUMMARY",
        "The increasingly stringent regulations on per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has highlighted the need to develop adsorbents with higher capacity and selectivity towards PFAS in the presence of interfering adsorbates . A comprehensive understanding of the molecular-level interactions governing the removal of PFAS by sorption-based processes is useful for the development of adsorbents with enhanced PFAS removal performance. By appending different functional groups onto a representative porous polymer network (PPN) , the disclosure elucidated the relative significance of different PFAS binding interactions. The importance of hydrophobic, electrostatic, f luorophilic , and hydrogen-bonding interactions were systematically investigated for the removal of a wide range of PFAS from complex water matrices . While electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions served as the dominant mechanisms for PFAS binding, fluorophilic and hydrogen-bonding interactions were found to further enhance the selectivity of these adsorbents towards PFAS.

        "Treatment technologies for the removal of PFAS from water include adsorption, membrane separation, electrochemical degradation, and foam fractionation. Of these, adsorption-based processes are often considered among the best available technologies due to their low cost, high uptake capacity, and ease of implementation. Common commercial PFAS adsorbents include granular activated carbons (GACs) , anion exchange resins (AERs) , and surface-modified clays (SMCs) . These materials leverage non-covalent interactions with PFAS molecules to drive their uptake. While GACs rely predominantly on hydrophobic interactions for PFAS adsorption, AERs and SMCs employ a combination of both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. However, these commercial adsorbents can suffer from low selectivities over competing solutes (especially for short-chain PFAS) , long equilibration times, \n\nand are typically marketed as single-use. These drawbacks highlight the significant need to develop reuseable adsorbents that provide high-performance removal of a broad variety of PFAS.",
        "Porous polymer networks (PPNs) , also known as porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) , are a class of exceptionally porous and tunable polymers that have been developed and studied for the removal of a wide range of contaminants from water. Functionalized porous polymer networks (PPNs) , comprise covalently linked organic monomers, are an emerging class of material that have been used in the high- performance removal of various organic and inorganic contaminants from water. The high porosity, tunability, and structural robustness of PPNs also make them ideal candidates for the removal of PFAS from water .",
        "The high surface area (>5600 m²/g) , tunable pore size and functionality, as well as chemical stability of PPNs has made them ideal adsorbents for the removal of contaminants such as Cu²⁺, Fe³⁺, Hg⁺, Au³⁺, B(OH)₃, U0;²⁺, and Nd³⁺from water, achieving among the highest reported capacities, fastest kinetics, and unprecedented selectivity for these species. In a recent study, PPNs were employed for the removal of PFOA from deionized (DI) water, exhibiting 32.0 and 24.1 times higher adsorption capacities than DFB-CDP ( [3-cyclodextrin ([3- CD) -based polymer network) and activated carbon, respectively, under similar operating conditions.",
        "One of the major distinctions between PPNs and commercial adsorbents is the capacity of PPNs to be appended with various functional groups. The ability to modify both the pore structure and functionality of PPNs with excellent chemical precision can be leveraged to optimize the desired interactions between PPNs and PFAS, enabling more effective removal performance. For example, the fluorination of adsorbents is of recent interest due to fluorophilic interactions. The combination of steric and electronic effects between fluorinated alkyl chains has been shown to be more energetically favorable than traditional hydrophobic interactions between nonfluorinated alkyl chains, leading to more selective PFAS adsorption. \n\nSystematic chemical modification of PPNs provides a useful method for discerning the contribution of governing interactions (i.e. , electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, and f luorophilic ) in the long- and short-chain PFAS sorption process during the treatment of complex water matrices .",
        "To date, the majority of studies evaluating the PFAS removal performance of novel adsorbents (i.e. , metal organic frameworks (MOF) , carbon nanotubes (CNTs) , functionalized organic polymers, etc. ) have focused on the determination of adsorption capacities of long-chain PFAS (i.e. , PFOA and PFOS) in simple water matrices. However, due to the challenges associated with the removal of short-chain PFCAs from real water matrices such as groundwater (GW) and wastewater (WW) , a comprehensive characterization of a novel adsorbent's performance necessitates a rigorous evaluation of its capability to remove both short- and long-chain perfluorosuf onic acids (PFSA) and PFCAs in the presence of interfering DOC.",
        "Although PPNs can provide a robust, highly-porous adsorbent scaffold, it is the covalently appended functional groups that are responsible for PFAS binding. Understanding PFAS binding mechanisms is thus a prerequisite for the development of improved PFAS adsorption sites in not only PPNs but any adsorbent material. When targeting PFAS uptake, favorable interactions with both the polar head and non-polar tail of the molecule can be leveraged. While the PFAS head can engage in hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic interactions, the tail can participate in hydrophobic and f luorophilic interactions. To enable the design of next-generation PFAS adsorbents, the relative importance of these interactions must be elucidated.",
        "The efficacy of PFAS removal by sorption-based processes is complex and depends on the physicochemical properties of both the targeted PFAS (i.e. , chain length/linearity, degree of fluorination, and polarity of headgroup) and adsorbent media (e.g. , available adsorbent surface area, porosity, surface functionalization, and polarity) , as well as the presence and identity of competitive adsorbates in the impacted water. Electrostatic and hydrophobic \n\ninteractions are considered the dominant mechanisms responsible for the adsorption of PFAS onto commercial adsorbents. However, hydrogenbonding, van der Waals interactions, and fluorophilic interactions can also lead to improved PFAS removal. Depending on the adsorbent, however, not all binding mechanisms may be leveraged simultaneously. For example, GAC relies predominantly on hydrophobic interactions for PFAS adsorption, leading to poor capacities and selectivities . Meanwhile, the relatively high observed perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) capacity of AER and AER-like adsorbents (e.g. , SMC) is believed to be due to the combination of both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. To date, the assessment of the removal mechanisms of PFAS by adsorbents has been predominantly conducted qualitatively. Thus, a systematic evaluation of the contribution of different PFAS binding interactions would provide insights into the development of next generation adsorbents, ultimately leading to improved PFAS removal by sorption-based processes. Through the installation of distinct functional groups onto a representative polymer backbone, factors critical to the optimization of PFAS binding can be probed experimentally .",
        "The disclosure provides porous polymers functionalized with an absorbent having PFAS-selective binding groups. The adsorbent is synthesized by the post-synthetic modification of porous polymer network 6 (PPN-6, aka PAF-1) , or a similar porous polymer backbone (please note that node or linker chemical structure can be modified as elucidated herein) . The material features PFAS-selective binding groups, which are in the form of, for example, fluorinated alkylamines or ammoniums, non-f luorinated alkylamines or ammoniums, fluorinated ethers, non-f luorinated ethers, or fluorinated thioethers. The materials also feature high surface areas and exceptional stability in harsh conditions. Because of the appended functional groups, the PPN is an excellent adsorbent for PFAS. The data provided herein show that these adsorbents remove a multitude of different PFAS (long-chain, short-chain, carboxylate, and sulfonate) from water with very high capacities, fast kinetics, high selectivity, and good recyclability. \n\nFurthermore , the data demonstrates that these adsorbents work well to remove PFAS from real contaminated water samples , with little consequence of the chemical complexity of the water matrix . The material exhibits excellent performance because it leverages electrostatic , hydrogen-bonding , hydrophobic , and fluorophilic interactions with the target PFAS molecules , strongly binding them within the pores of the polymer . Furthermore , these adsorbents can be incorporated into mixed-matrix membranes and pellets , allowing for their application in electrodialys is cells , diffus ion dialysis cells , and adsorption columns . These materials are unique because most of these functional groups have never been appended onto a porous polymer in the past . Similar porous polymer networks are rare in the literature , and rarer still is their application towards the removal of PFAS from solution . The materials and their applications described in this disclosure are unique compared to all other materials reported in the literature .",
        "To this end, a representative porous polymer network ( PPN- 6 ) was post-synthetically appended with the functional groups illustrated in Figure 1 . These functional groups were selected because they are expected to engage in unique combinations of electrostatic , hydrogen-bonding , hydrophobic , and fluorophilic interactions with various PFAS molecules . For instance , functional groups containing cationic ammonium moieties can engage in electrostatic interactions with anionic PFAS , but the neutral ether derivatives cannot . Meanwhile , the quaternary ammonium cations rely on electrostatic interactions , but the secondary ammonium cations can also engage in hydrogen-bonding . Hydrophobic and fluorophilic interactions are generated by including alkyl or fluoroalkyl moieties within the functional group . The investigation of these functionalized PPNs not only revealed the relative importance of PFAS binding interactions but also yielded some of the most effective PFAS adsorbents reported to date .",
        "The library of functionali zed porous polymer networks ( PPNs ) presented in the disclosure allow for the direct comparison of \n\nelectrostatic , hydrophobic , hydrogen-bonding , and fluorophilic interactions with respect to their impact on PFAS adsorption . Batch adsorption experiments , along with computational analysis revealed that electrostatic interactions originating from positively charged adsorbents play a role in PFAS binding and uptake of short-chain PFAS . In water matrices , adsorbents featuring a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic or fluorophilic interactions exhibit stronger PFAS binding and greater selectivity compared to those capable exclusively of electrostatic , hydrophobic , or fluorophilic interactions . With regard to the latter two interactions , fluorinated adsorbents bind PFAS with greater selectivity than their non-f luorinated counterparts . In the binding of short-chain PFAS , hydrogen-bonding proved to be a significant driving interaction . In one embodiment , a pH-independent positive charge is used when treating complex water matrices . PPN- 6- FNDMB , functionali zed with N, N-dimethyl-3 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 4 - pentaf luorobutylamine ( as described more fully elsewhere herein ) , exhibited strong PFAS adsorption performance compared to the other PPNs and commercial adsorbents .",

        "The compos itions of the disclosure can be used over similar/ competing technologies ( or in combination with similar/ competing technologies ) because the compos itions of the disclosure provide a s ignificantly better PFAS adsorbent than what is already described in the literature and is being used commercially .

The material can also be integrated into a variety of form-factors ( such as pellets and membranes ) that expand the range of potential applications and lowers \n\nthe barriers to implementation at the commercial scale. The high degree of tunability of the PPN also presents a significant advantage over competing technologies. Modifications can be made with relative synthetic ease to adapt the material to specific applications.  The compositions of the disclosure were evaluate to determine their: 1) role of different functional groups within PPNs and the importance of their associated binding mechanisms (i.e. , electrostatic, hydrophobic, f luorophilic, and hydrogen bonding) on PFAS removal performance; 2) adsorption capacities and kinetics for individual PFAS, as well as the extent of competitive adsorption between long- and short-chain PFSAs and PFCAs; 3) adsorption selectivity for PFAS in the presence of interfering DOC in ground water (GW) and waste water (WW) ; and 4) regeneration and cyclability potential of the adsorbent, concurrent with PFAS recovery and concentration for disposal or destruction. To meet these objectives, a representative PPN-6 was appended with various PFAS-selective functional groups to experimentally probe the significance of individual binding interactions.

For the deionized water experiments, PPN-6-FNDMB was added to the PFOA- spiked deionized water at an adsorbent mass to volume ratio of 0.25 g/L and an initial PFOA concentration of 1.0 mN. The samples were shaken at room temperature at 150 rpm for 8 h. The samples were then centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed by LCMS-MS for quantification of the residual PFAS. For the groundwater experiments, PPN-6-FNDMB was added to groundwater samples at an adsorbent mass to volume ratio of 0.08 g/L. The samples were then shaken and filtered similarly to in the deionized water experiments. The lower adsorbent mass to volume ratio used for the groundwater experiments was to ensure that residual PFAS would be detectable in the centrifuged supernatant for analysis. The adsorbed PFAS was then desorbed from PPN-6-FNDMB using a 1: 1 mixture of methanol and 1.0 M aqueous sodium hydroxide at an adsorbent mass to regeneration solution volume ratio of 3:1 or 1:5 g/L. The mixture was shaken at 150 rpm for 8 h and the PPN-6-FNDMB was recovered by centrifugation. The PFAS concentration in the supernatant from the deionized water experiment was measured to quantify the extent of PFOA desorption from PPN-6-FNDMB. However, due to the limited volume and high salinity of the desorption supernatant, combined with low PFAS levels limiting the ability to dilute the samples, the desorbed PFAS concentrations from the groundwater experiments were not measured. The recovered PPN-6-FNDMB was then resuspended in 1 mN aqueous HC1 before being filtered and washed with H2O and MeOH (300 mL each) . The PPN-6-FNDMB was then dried at 110 °C overnight before being reweighed and used in the next adsorption cycle.",
        "DFT Calculations. First-principles DFT calculations were performed using Gaussian 16 package. All structures were fully optimized at the B3LYP level of theory, utilizing the 6-311+G(d,p) basis set, and the polarized continuum model (PCM) was applied to simulate the water-solvated state. The DFT-calculated adsorption energy Eₐdₛ) of PFPeA on a PPN-6 derivative, namely PPN-6-FBE, -QA, -NDMB, -FNDMB, or -FNB, was obtained by the following definition: \n\n Eads Ecₒₘₚᵢₑₓ(EpPN₋₆ dₑᵣᵢᵥₐₜᵢᵥₑ+ EPFPₑA) (2)",

        "Molecular Dynamics Simulations. Simulation models of",
        "PPN-6 and its derivative, PPN-6-FNDMB, were constructed to explore the permeation behaviors of PFAS molecules through the frameworks. A diamond-like bulk model was introduced to design the PPN-6 framework through the insertion of biphenyl unit between every C-C bond. Subsequently, the PPN-6-FNDMB framework was designed through the additional modification of PPN-6 via the integration of a FNDMB moiety onto each biphenyl unit, replacing a hydrogen atom on the ortho position of each biphenyl group with FNDMB functional group. The designed models were geometrically optimized using Materials Studio. The physical properties of the constructed PPN-6 model were \n\nconfirmed by assessing its surface area and pore volume against their reference values, exhibiting the reliable representation of the simulation model with a close correspondence with errors of only 4% and 6%, respectively. For the constructed models, classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted using the large- scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator in conjunction with the DREIDING force field. The total potential energy (Eₜₒₜₐᵢ') of each model was determined using the following equation:",

Bonded interaction energies, such as bond stretching (Ebₒₙcₗ') , angle bending Wangle} , and torsional (Eₜₒᵣₛᵢₒₙ) energies, were also included in the equation to update the time-evolved molecular behaviors . The electrostatic component within the simulation domain was handled using the particle-particle particle-mesh solver. Notably, charges of all the atoms in the simulation models were refined via density functional theory calculations, implemented in the Gaussian 16 package with the B3LYP functional and 6-311+G(d,p) basis set, to mirror the molecular electrostatic potentials. These models were first equilibrated through a sequential introduction of NVT (298 K) and NPT (298 K and 1 atm) ensembles, each for a duration of 2 ns, utilizing Nose-Hoover thermostat and barostat to calibrate temperature and pressure, respectively. The steered MD simulations were further employed to predict the changes in the free energy (i.e. , potential of mean force) for PFAS molecules, namely PFOS, PFBS, PFOA, and PFPeA, passing through the designed frameworks of PPN-6 and PPN-6-FNDMB, with the aim of elucidating the energetic preferences for molecular pathways. These simulations were conducted through applying an additional force to PFAS molecules in a positive x direction under the conditions of a spring constant of 1000 kcal/mol/A²and a pulling speed of 2xl0~⁵A/fs for a period of 2 ns.  Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Functionalized PPN-6. The parent PPN-6 framework, having tetrahedral carbon nodes bridged by biphenyl linkers, was synthesized via the Yamamoto coupling of a tetrakis (4-bromophenyl) methane monomer. After \n\naromatic chloromethylation of the biphenyl units, PPN-6-QA, -NDMB, - NB, -FNB, and -FNDMB were isolated via nucleophilic substitution with the corresponding amine (Figure 1) . Two other materials, PPN-6- BE and -FBE were prepared through a Williamson ether synthesis between the chloromethylated PPN-6 and the corresponding alcohol.  The successful incorporation of these functional groups was confirmed qualitatively by Fourier-trans f orm infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The spectra of PPN-6-QA, -NDMB, -NB, -FNB, and -FNDMB showed new absorption bands in the region of 1580-1700 cnr¹, corresponding to the C-N stretches, while the spectra of PPN-6-BE and -FBE gained signals associated with C-0 stretching at approximately 1100 cm⁻¹(Figure 8A-B) . Meanwhile, the prominent signal at 1200 cm⁻¹observed for PPN-6-FNB, -FNDMB, and -FBE is characteristic of the similar C-F stretches found in each of these fluorinated adsorbents.",
        "The extent of functional group incorporation into the PPN was determined to be 3.1, 3.6, 2.7, 2.5, and 1.9 mmol/g for PPN-6- QA, -NB, -NDMB, -FNB, and -FNDMB, respectively, based on nitrogen content from CHN elemental analysis (Figure 1 and Table S8) . The functional group loadings in PPN-6-BE and -FBE were approximately 4.1 and 0.6 mmol/g, respectively, as determined by quantitative²H and¹⁹F solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The NMR spectra of PPN-6-FBE also revealed that during the Williamson ether synthesis, one methylene fluorine atom was partially exchanged for a hydrogen atom",
        "(Figure 1) .",
        "The permanent microporosity of the PPNs was confirmed by N₂adsorption isotherms collected at 77 K. The Brunauer-Emmett- Teller (BET) surface area of PPN-6 was 4780 m²/g, and that of the functionalized PPNs ranged from 2110-690 m²/g, depending on functional group identity and extent of incorporation (Figures 1 and 9) . The decrease in surface area upon functionalization of the PPN is similarly described in previous reports and is due to the partial occupation of the pores by the functional groups and their additional mass. The low surface areas of PPN-6-BE and -FBE compared to the other PPNs could potentially be due to residual synthesis byproducts not being removed during adsorbent washing and activation. Nonetheless, the relatively high surface area of the functionalized \n\nPPNs suggests the high accessibility of the functional groups within the materials.",
        "Gravimetric PFAS Adsorption Capacities. Adsorption capacities of the synthesized materials were evaluated using singlesolute adsorption experiments conducted in deionized water with high initial PFAS concentrations (~1 mmol/L) and long equilibration times (8 h) to ensure adsorbent saturation. Specifically, per f luorooctanoic acid (PFOA) , perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) , perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) , and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) were chosen as representative long- and short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic and sulfonic acids, respectively. The concentration of the PFAS were measured by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-f light mass spectrometry. Figure 2A and Table 9 provide the gravimetric equilibrium PFAS adsorption capacities of the adsorbents in terms of mmol PFAS/g adsorbent. Commercially available samples of F400 granular activated carbon (GAC) , FS200 surface-modified clay (SMC) , and CalRes2301 anion exchange resin (AER) were also tested for comparison (see Tables 3-5 for commercial adsorbent properties) .",
        "Unfunctionalized PPN-6 displayed low adsorption capacities (<1.0 mmol/g) for all tested PFAS, suggesting only weak interactions between PFAS and the PPN backbone. The PPNs possessing positively charged functional groups (e.gr., PPN-6-QA, -NB, -NDMB, - FNB, and -FNDMB) exhibited high adsorption capacities for both long- chain (up to 4.0 mmol/g for PFOA and PFOS) and short-chain PFAS (up to 2.3 mmol/g for PFPeA and 3.5 mmol/g for PFBS) . Meanwhile, the PPNs employing only hydrophobic or fluorophilic interactions (PPN-6- BE and -FBE) exhibited low adsorption capacities for both shortchain (<0.25 mmol/g for PFPeA and PFBS) and long-chain PFAS (~1.0 mmol/g for PFOA, and up to 2.5 mmol/g for PFOS) . Compared to commercial adsorbents, the positively charged PPNs exhibited an order of magnitude higher capacity than GAC and SMC for all tested PFAS, and up to 3.5 times the capacity of AER (Figure 2A) .",
        "PFAS Binding Efficiency. The adsorption efficiency (i.e., the adsorption capacity normalized by functional group loading) can be used to evaluate the performance of different functional groups within the PPNs more accurately. The adsorption efficiency of the \n\nPPNs for long-chain (average of PFOA and PFOS capacities) and shortchain (average of PFPeA and PFBS capacities) PFAS is shown in Figure 2B, with individual PFAS data in Table 9. From these data, several preliminary assessments on PFAS binding interactions can be made:",
        "(1) Electrostatic interactions - Although the neutral PPN-6-BE and -FBE do bind long-chain PFAS, their short-chain PFAS adsorption efficiency is significantly lower than that of the cationic PPNs (PPN-6-QA, -NB, -FNB, -NDMB, and -FNDMB) . Unlike long-chain PFAS, short-chain PFAS lack large non-polar regions that can participate in van der Waals interactions with adsorbents. Electrostatic interactions are thus vital for the adsorption of short-chain PFAS.",
        "(2) Hydrophobic interactions - The adsorption efficiency of PPN-6- BE suggests that hydrophobic interactions alone are not sufficient for the adsorption of short-chain PFAS, but do enable the uptake of long-chain PFAS. However, the effect of complimentary hydrophobic interactions on the long-chain PFAS adsorption efficiencies of the cationic PPNs is ambiguous, with PPN-6-QA having a higher efficiency than PPN-6-NB and -FNB but a lower efficiency than PPN-6-NDMB and - FNDMB. Given that this experiment is conducted in deionized water and that the PFAS do not have to compete with other non-target solutes for adsorbent binding sites, the advantages of combined electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions are likely suppressed.",
        "(3) Hydrogen-bonding interactions - While PPN-6-QA, -BE, -FBE, - NDMB, and -FNDMB display much greater binding efficiencies for long- chain PFAS compared to short-chain PFAS, PPN-6-NB and -FNB adsorb almost equivalent amounts of each. This suggests that hydrogenbonding interactions play a more important role in the uptake of short-chain PFAS than for long-chain PFAS. Unlike long-chain PFAS that can engage in significant van der Waals interactions with binding groups via their tail, short-chain PFAS adsorption is more reliant on binding interactions with their polar head group.",
        "(4) Fluorophilic interactions - Fluorinating the PPNs generally leads to increased PFAS adsorption efficiency. Compared to their non-f luorinated counterparts, PPN-6-FBE and -FNDMB adsorb significantly more long- and short-chain PFAS per functional group. While the difference in binding efficiency between PPN-6-NB and -FNB \n\nis les s clear , the overall results suggest that fluorophilic interactions are more favorable than hydrophobic interactions alone .  Besides the abovementioned binding interactions , another pos sible factor driving PFAS uptake is the aggregation of PFAS within the pores of the PPNs . Indeed, PPN- 6-QA, -FBE , -NDMB, and - FNDMB have long-chain PFAS adsorption efficiencies >1 . This aggregation is expected to be more prominent for long-chain PFAS due to their low critical micelle concentrations . Lower functional group loadings could also allow for increased PFAS aggregation due to reduced steric constraints . This could potentially explain the exceptionally high long-chain adsorption efficiency of PPN- 6-FBE .",
        "Calculated PFPeA Adsorption Energies . To more quantitatively elucidate the relative importance of di fferent binding interactions on PFAS adsorption, dens ity functional theory calculations were performed . Select PPNs were represented as a single functionalized biphenyl unit, and a molecule of PFPeA was used in these calculations because it had proven the most di fficult to adsorb in the single-solute experiments .",
        "The calculated adsorption energies support the experimentally determined importance of electrostatic interactions in short-chain PFAS binding (Figure 3 ) . The presence of a cationic ammonium moiety causes the binding energy to at least quadruple in magnitude compared to that of the neutral PPN- 6-FBE model . Further supporting the results of the previous section, hydrophobic interactions lead to minimal increases in PFAS binding in this ideali zed scenario . Compared to the PPN- 6-QA model , the PPN- 6-NDMB model has j ust a ~1 kJ/mol greater in magnitude PFPeA binding energy . Meanwhile , the introduction of fluorophilic interactions leads to a ~4 kJ/mol more energetically favorable binding of PFPeA, when comparing the PPN- 6-FNDM and -NDMB models .",
        "The computational data also corroborates the importance of hydrogen-bonding interactions on short-chain PFAS binding . Compared to the PPN- 6-FNDMB model , the PPN- 6-FNB model has an adsorption energy ~23 kJ/mol greater in magnitude . The secondary ammonium of the FNB binding group is not only capable of engaging in stabili zing hydrogen-bonding interactions , but the smaller steric \n\nprofile also allows the PFPeA carboxylate to get approximately 0.6 A closer to the nitrogen atom of the ammonium cation.",
        "PFAS Binding Selectivity Over Competing Solutes. Often, PFAS-impacted waters contain complex mixtures of long- and shortchain PFAS at concentrations that are orders of magnitude lower than the 1 mmol/L used for the determination of maximum adsorption capacities and efficiencies. Moreover, it is well reported that long- and short-chain PFAS often compete for adsorbent binding sites, with the long-chain molecules being adsorbed. Typical water samples also contain other inorganic and organic solutes at concentrations much higher than that of the targeted PFAS. By testing the adsorbents in deionized water and wastewater (water composition shown in Table 6) spiked with 250 nmol/L each of PFOA, PFOS, PFPeA, and PFBS, the binding selectivity between different PFAS and for PFAS over competing solutes was evaluated (Figure 4) .  In deionized water (Figure 4) , the PPNs containing cationic ammonium moieties (PPN-6-QA, -NB, -FNB, -NDMB, and -FNDMB) exhibited excellent removal of both the long- and short-chain PFAS (<10% less short-chain PFAS removed than long-chain PFAS) .",
        "Meanwhile, the uncharged PPN-6-BE and -FBE removed 74% and 65% less short-chain PFAS than long-chain, respectively. Under these dilute conditions in the absence of competing ions, the commercial SMC, GAC, and AER removed 27%, 44%, and 17% less short-chain PFAS than long-chain, respectively. With respect to total PFAS removal from deionized water, PPN-6-QA, -NB, -FNB, -NDMB, and -FNDMB outperformed both the neutral PPN-6-BE and -FBE, as well as the tested commercial adsorbents .",
        "All of the adsorbents tested exhibited a decrease in total gravimetric PFAS adsorption capacity in wastewater (Figure 4) compared to deionized water. In addition to the spiked ~1 pmol/L of PFAS, the wastewater contains over 300 mg/L of inorganic solutes and 4.5 mg/L of dissolved organic matter. The decrease in PFAS adsorption capacity can be attributed to interference from a combination of these inorganic and organic solutes, as determined from experiments conducted in synthetic wastewater containing similar concentrations of inorganic ions, but no dissolved organic carbon. Notably, the majority of this decrease originated from less \n\nuptake of short-chain PFAS, particularly PFPeA. Considering that short-chain PFAS engage in weaker van der Waals interactions than their long-chain analogs, non-target solutes can more readily compete with short-chain PFAS for adsorbent binding sites. Consequently, the relative importance of different PFAS binding interactions in wastewater differs slightly compared to those established in deionized water.",
        "Limited in deionized water, the short-chain PFAS adsorption capacity of the neutral PPN-6-BE becomes negligible in wastewater. Meanwhile, PPN-6-QA, engaging primarily in electrostatic interactions, retained the ability to bind short-chain PFAS despite exhibiting a 24% decrease in total PFAS adsorption capacity in wastewater compared to deionized water. As for the single-solute experiments in deionized water, electrostatic interactions remain vital to the adsorption of short-chain PFAS in wastewater.",
        "Unlike PPN-6-QA, PPN-6-NDMB can engage in both electrostatic (with the PFAS head) and hydrophobic (with the PFAS tail) interactions, limiting the capacity drop to only 14% in wastewater. Ambiguous in the single-solute experiments, the benefits of complementary hydrophobic interactions in the cationic PPNs become apparent in these wastewater results. In wastewater, nontarget solutes compete for adsorbent binding sites and leveraging both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions helps retain PFAS at adsorption sites within the PPN.",
        "While the total capacity of PPN-6-FNDMB and -FBE decreased by 9% and 21%, respectively, that of their non-f luorinated analogs, PPN-6-NDMB and -BE, decreased by 14% and 32% in wastewater. Like the single-solute experiments in deionized water, the results of the multi-solute wastewater experiments indicate that in both neutral and cationic PPNs, fluorophilic interactions lead to stronger PFAS binding compared to hydrophobic interactions.",
        "The positive effect of hydrogen-bonding on PFAS binding selectivity is realized by comparing PPN-6-NB, which contains a secondary ammonium, and PPN-6-NDMB, which contains a quaternary ammonium. Relative to in deionized water, the capacities of PPN-6-NB and -NDMB decrease by 10% and 14%, respectively, in wastewater. As noted in the single-solute deionized water experiments, hydrogen- \n\nbonding interactions can play a role in short-chain PFAS adsorption due to their limited ability to participate in binding interactions via their tail.",
        "Given these established trends in binding interactions, it was hypothesized that PPN-6-FNB, which can engage in electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen-bonding, and fluorophilic interactions, would have the highest retained PFAS capacity in wastewater. In reality, the adsorption capacity of PPN-6-FNB decreased by 33% — the largest decrease of all the PPNs. While the secondary ammoniums in PPN-6-NB and -FNB allow them to engage in hydrogen-bonding, it also makes them susceptible to deprotonation and loss of electrostatic interactions. The simulated pA% of a molecular analog of PPN-6-NB is 9.85, but the same molecular analog of PPN-6-FNB has a p i of only 8.16 due to the electron withdrawing nature of the fluoroalkyl chain. The low short-chain PFAS adsorption capacity of PPN-6-FNB in wastewater is thus likely due to the partial deprotonation of the adsorbent. Further evidence supporting this is that the adsorption capacity of PPN-6-FNB increases in wastewater adjusted to pH 4 (Figure 4) .",
        "When changing from deionized water to wastewater, PPN-6- NB, -NDMB, and -FNDMB significantly outperformed commercial GAC, SMC, and AER, which exhibited decreases in total PFAS adsorption capacity of 55%, 37%, and 24%, respectively (Figure 4) . The combination of binding interactions present in the PPNs, along with their high density of functional groups, are likely responsible for their improved performance over commercial adsorbents.",
        "PFAS Removal from AFFF- Impacted Groundwater. Aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) is a proprietary mixture of PFAS and hydrocarbon surfactants used as fire extinguishers at airports, fire stations, refineries, military sites, and other facilities across the globe. The widespread use of AFFF during emergencies and firefighting training activities has led to significant PFAS contamination of groundwater and surface water near these sites. As a more practically relevant test of adsorbent performance, the PPN and commercial adsorbents were dispersed into an unmodified sample of AFFF-impacted groundwater collected from a US Air Force base. \n\n The detected PFAS and their concentrations in the AFFF- impacted groundwater are summarized in Table 7. In this sample, 21 anionic PFAS were identified with a total PFAS concentration of over 78, 000 ppt. These PFAS can be categorized as perfluorosulfonic acids, perfluorocarboxylic acids, perfluorosulfonamides, f luorotelomers , and cyclic PFAS (Figure 5) . Although many of these PFAS are currently unregulated by environmental protection agencies, they are contaminants of emerging concern that demonstrate high bioaccumulation potentials .",
        "A high water volume to adsorbent mass ratio (50 L/g) was used in these experiments to afford quantifiable PFAS concentrations in the water samples post-adsorption. As such, insight into the adsorbent selectivity towards different PFAS molecules could be elucidated. When a ratio of 15 L/g was used, almost complete removal of all PFAS was observed, highlighting the excellent performance of the PPN adsorbents, but leaving little room for comparison between adsorbents (Figure 10A-B) .",
        "The re are several PFAS adsorption trends consistent across all the tested adsorbents (Figure 5) :",
        "(1) Long-chain PFAS were more effectively removed than their short-chain analogs with the same head group (e.g. , removal of PFOS > PFBS) . When compared to shorter PFAS, longer fluoroalkyl chains are expected to engage in stronger and more numerous van der Waals interactions with adsorbents.",
        "(2) Sulfonic acids are removed more effectively than carboxylic acids of equal tail length, with the removal of sulfonamides falling between them (e.g., removal of PFPeS > FPeSA > PFHxA) . Calculated electrostatic potential maps suggest that sulfonic acid head groups are softer and more polarizable than carboxylic acids, meaning they engage more readily in electrostatic interactions with adsorbents.",
        "(3) The removal of f luorotelomers , in which two of the tail carbons are not fluorinated, is significantly lower than that of their fully fluorinated analogs (e.g. , removal of 4:2 FTS < PFHxS) . Thus, modulating the polarity of the tail has implications on adsorbability . \n\n (4) According to the performance of SMC and GAC, the cyclic PFAS is removed to a slightly lesser degree than its linear counterpart with the same number of carbons (e.g., removal of PFEtCHxS < PFOS) . The larger steric profile and decreased flexibility of the cyclic PFAS likely lead to weaker interactions with adsorbents.",
        "Together, these trends illustrate some of the nuances of PFAS adsorption and the importance of developing adsorbents capable of removing a broad range of PFAS.",
        "Although the adsorbents all followed the above-mentioned trends, individual adsorbent performance varied significantly. As expected from the selectivity experiments, PPN-6-FNDMB outperforms PPN-6-NDMB, which outperforms PPN-6-QA in the removal of short-chain PFAS (e.g. , PFBA, PFPeA, FBSA, and 4:2 FTS) . This again demonstrates the importance of combining electrostatic and hydrophobic or fluorophilic interactions and reaffirms that fluorophilic interactions are more advantageous than hydrophobic interactions.",
        "Notably, while PPN-6-NB outperformed PPN-6-QA in wastewater (Figure 4) , the opposite was true in the AFFF-impacted groundwater. As with PPN-6-FNB in wastewater, the slightly basic nature of the groundwater (pH ~ 8.9) likely led to the partial deprotonation of PPN-6-NB and loss of electrostatic interactions with PFAS molecules. Hydrogen-bonding via the secondary ammonium group in PPN-6-NB and -FNB may lend additional selectivity in neutral or acidic water matrices, but anion exchange interactions via a quaternary ammonium are more reliable when it comes to treating a broader range of PFAS-impacted water samples.",
        "The PFAS removal from the AFFF-impacted groundwater by commercial adsorbents increased from GAC < SMC < AER, consistent with reported trends suggesting that the AER (CalRes2301) is one of the best commercially available PFAS adsorbents. Remarkably, both PPN-6-NDMB and -FNDMB achieved more complete PFAS removal than AER, especially with respect to short-chain PFAS. The exceptional performance of PPN-6-NDMB and -FNDMB places them among the most effective PFAS adsorbents reported to date.",
        "Other promising PFAS adsorbents are reported in the literature, but adsorption experiments are often limited to long- \n\nchain legacy PFAS (e.g. , PFOA and/or PFOS) removal from simple water matrices (e.g., deionized water) . Future research towards novel adsorbents should emphasize the treatment of real contaminated waters, allowing for more meaningful and relevant conclusions and comparisons to be drawn.",
        "PFAS Adsorption Kinetics. As the best-performing adsorbent, PPN-6-FNDMB warranted further investigation into its PFAS removal metrics. Adsorption kinetics are among the most important adsorbent properties due to their direct implications on the determination of industrially relevant parameters such as empty bed contact time and adsorbent bed size. Experiments were conducted in deionized water and wastewater spiked with PFOA, PFOS, PFPeA, and PFBS at individual concentrations of 250 nmol/L (Figure 6) .",
        "Near-complete PFAS removal from deionized water was achieved in under 30 s by PPN-6-FNDMB (Figure 6) . The exceptionally fast adsorption kinetics of PPN-6-FNDMB can be attributed to its high surface area and porosity, and small particle size, facilitating PFAS access to binding sites. Individual PFAS adsorption data (Figure 11) reveals that PPN-6-FNDMB removed each PFAS at the same rapid rate.",
        "Commercial GAC and SMC did not reach adsorption equilibrium during the 3h testing period (Figure 6A) but displayed an initial rapid uptake of PFAS within the first 3 min of the experiment (Figure 6B) . Similarly, AER removed approximately 60% of PFAS within the first 3 min, but adsorption of the remaining 40% required the full 3h. Unlike for PPN-6-FNDMB, the rate of PFAS adsorption in the commercial adsorbents was dependent on PFAS identity. Adsorption rates followed similar trends as adsorption capacity, with PFOS being removed the quickest, and PFPeA the slowest. Thus, adsorption kinetics are not only dictated by intraparticle diffusion but also binding affinity. The equally rapid adsorption of each PFAS by PPN-6-FNDMB attests to the high binding affinity of the FNDMB functional group for both long- and shortchain PFAS.",
        "When these kinetics experiments were repeated in wastewater, PPN-6-FNDMB exhibited the expected decrease in PFAS adsorption capacity but still reached equilibrium within 30 s \n\n(Figure 6, hollow circles) . Similarly rapid equilibration times (<30 s) were recorded for PPN-6-FNDMB in the presence of 0.8 mN PFOS or PFPeA, confirming that adsorption occurs within the pores of the PPN and not solely on the particle surface (Figure 12) . Rapid kinetics are likewise reported in the literature for PPNs towards their respective target solutes, further highlighting the advantages of this class of material for water purification.",
        "Adsorbent Recyclability. The regeneration potential of an adsorbent holds significant importance for practical applications, decreasing spent media waste and providing a recyclability advantage over their single-use counterparts. A combination of brine (or caustic brine) and organic cosolvent has been shown to successfully desorb PFAS from adsorbents through disruption of non-covalent interactions. In this work, PFAS were desorbed from PPN-6-FNDMB using a 50/50 mixture of methanol and 1 M aqueous NaOH solution. The PPN-6-FNDMB was then reused in additional adsorption experiments.",
        "To validate the effectiveness of the desorption conditions before more rigorous testing, recycling experiments were first conducted in deionized water spiked with PFOA. After three consecutive adsorption/desorption cycles, the adsorption capacity of PPN-6-FNDMB for PFOA in deionized water decreased by less than 5%. The desorbed PFOA was also quantified, confirming the successful leaching and regeneration of PPN-6-FNDMB.",
        "Adsorbent cycling experiments were then repeated in AFFF- impacted groundwater to explore the effect of interfering solutes on the PFAS removal performance of recycled PPN-6-FNDMB (Figure 7) . While the removal of long-chain PFAS from the groundwater samples remained relatively constant, the degree of short-chain PFAS removal by PPN-6-FNDMB decreased with each cycle, reaching 45% after 4 cycles. This decline in performance could be attributed to the fouling of PPN-6-FNDMB through either binding site occupation or pore blocking by competing organic or inorganic solutes.",
        "Decreasing the volume of desorption solution used per gram of PFAS-loaded PPN-6-FNDMB from 5.0 L to 0.3 L led to only ~7% less PFAS being removed from the AFFF-impacted groundwater during the third adsorption cycle. However, by using a minimal amount of desorption solution, the PFAS is isolated in a stream that is \n\nsigni ficantly more concentrated than the original contaminated source . This PFAS concentration factor is upwards of 50 times for the AFFF-impacted groundwater , based on initial concentrations and as suming complete desorption .",
        "It will be understood that various modi fications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure . Accordingly, other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims ."
